We are pleased to announce the launch of our latest cryptocurrency denominated account, Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

It means we are now offering three cryptocurrency denominated accounts – Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin, and Litecoin

## What is Bitcoin Cash?

Bitcoin Cash is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the Internet. 

This exciting new currency was recently formed when Bitcoin experienced a hard ‘fork’, which means it was split.

Bitcoin Cash derives its inherent value from Bitcoin and shares many of its characteristics. And, since its creation, it has been accepted by more and more exchanges. 

This gives it credibility and increases its value. Bitcoin Cash is currently the second most expensive cryptocurrency in the market.

## Create your BCH account now

Create your free BCH denominated account now and you can deposit, trade, and withdraw your payouts in BCH.

Plus, deposits and withdrawals are faster and more efficient as you won’t have to rely on credit cards and banks.

This is a fantastic opportunity to experience the cryptocurrency revolution that’s shaping the future of online trading. So, what are you waiting for?
