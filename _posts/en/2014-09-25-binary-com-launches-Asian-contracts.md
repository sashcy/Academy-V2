With the latest upgrade to our trading platform, you now get the opportunity to purchase Asian contracts on Random Indices.

Asian contracts pay out if the spot price at expiry time is higher or lower, than the average of the prices traded through (by the same market), over the duration of the contract.

The greatest advantage of these contracts is that the barrier is not predetermined at the time of purchase. Unlike fixed-barrier contracts, the barrier of an Asian contract changes with every new spot!  This means that, if you purchase an Asian "Rise" contract and the market immediately falls, the barrier will also decrease, giving you better odds of winning than a regular "Rise" contract.
