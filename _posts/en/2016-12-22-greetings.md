It’s that time of the year again the season to rejoice and reflect, of gratitude and giving.

We’re sending you our warmest wishes for the coming holidays to tell you how much we appreciate having you as a Binary.com client.

We hope to see you again next year and for many more years to come.

As part of our commitment to innovation, you will see a change in our branding from 2017 onwards. We’re revamping our tagline to ‘Trusted by traders since 2000’ to better convey our track record as the oldest and most trusted binary options provider for traders around the world.

If you can spare us five minutes of your time, please tell us how we can improve further in order to serve you better.

<strong>Tell us your favourite Binary.com feature and what we can do even better in 2017</strong>
