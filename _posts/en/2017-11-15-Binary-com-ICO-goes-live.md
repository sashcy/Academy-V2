We’re excited to inform you that our ICO has been officially launched. Bidding for the tokens is now underway until 25th December, 2017. <a href="https://ico_documents.binary.com/howto_ico.pdf">Learn how you can participate in the Binary.com ICO</a>

## The world’s first ICO with 18 years of history

The Binary.com ICO is unlike anything you’ve seen or heard before. Founded in 1999, we are a profitable and debt-free company that’s performing an ICO as a genuine substitute for an IPO.

To that end, we’re issuing securities-backed smart tokens while implementing best practices in corporate governance, investor disclosure, and transparency.

## Benefits of purchasing tokens

Our ICO will issue securities-backed smart tokens based on the ERC20 protocol that grant you rights to receive payments equivalent to shareholder dividends and convert the tokens into Ordinary Shares.

After the ICO, you will also be able to trade your tokens on the Lykke.com cryptoasset exchange, enabling the tokens to potentially increase in value.
