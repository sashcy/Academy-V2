Want to protect yourself against uncertain market conditions? Now you can have open positions in opposite directions of the same symbol.

We’ve enabled the hedging feature in our MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform – that’s available on desktop, mobile, and a web terminal – so you can enjoy the full potential of your trading strategies.

This hedging feature is similar to the one used in MetaTrader 4, and will feel familiar to traders who wish to upgrade to MT5. At the same time, you will be able to take advantage of the new features that are available exclusively on MT5, including up to six pending order types, netting, unlimited symbols, and exchange trading.

You can also set the Stop Loss and Take Profit levels for each order, and then see the profit level of each position you’ve taken in real time.

So what are you waiting for? Trade the Forex markets and Volatility Indices, using both demo and real accounts.
