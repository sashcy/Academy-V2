As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our products and services, we are consolidating all spread contracts solely on <a href="https://mt.binary.com" target="_blank">our MT5 platform</a>.

This means that we will discontinue all spread contracts for binary options on 31 March.

We firmly believe that MT5 is the ideal platform if you want to trade spread contracts on an ongoing basis.

We encourage you to sign up to our MT5 platform today to reap its full benefits, including:

<ul class="bullet">
    <li>Access to leverage that allows you to make bigger trades using smaller capital</li>
    <li>Advanced tools for technical and fundamental analysis</li>
    <li>State-of-the-art trading interface recognised as the industry standard worldwide</li>
</ul>

<p class="p--action"><a class="button" href="http://mt.binary.com/"><span>Trade spreads on MT5</span></a></p>

If you’ve been planning to register your MT5 account but don’t know how, we’ve prepared a 60-second video to help get you started.
