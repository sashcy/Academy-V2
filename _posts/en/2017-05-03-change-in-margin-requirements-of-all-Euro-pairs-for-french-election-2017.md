To mitigate potential market volatility from the final round of the French Election on 7 May 2017, Binary.com will be adopting a margin requirement of 2% for the following EUR pairs on our MT5 platform:

<ul class="bullet">
    <li>EUR/AUD</li>
    <li>EUR/CAD</li>
    <li>EUR/CHF</li>
	<li>EUR/GBP</li>
	<li>EUR/JPY</li>
	<li>EUR/NZD</li>
	<li>EUR/USD</li>
	<li>EUR/NOK</li>
	<li>EUR/PLN</li>
	<li>EUR/SEK</li>
</ul>

The margin requirements for our CFDs will remain at 2%.

#### The changes mentioned above will be implemented starting 5 May 2017 (Friday) at 12:00PM GMT.

We will continue to monitor market conditions and risk implications after the French Elections to determine the future margin requirements of all affected currency pairs and CFDs.


#### Important reminder for all traders

Please ensure that you possess sufficient equity in your trading accounts in order to accommodate these new margin requirements.
