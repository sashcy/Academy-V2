Binary.com is committed to providing its clients with the most competitive trading conditions. As the markets evolve, Binary.com follows suit by updating its products and services to meet client demands. To this effect, we are implementing new margin call and stop out levels on all MT5 accounts.

The following changes will come into effect on 16-17 December 2017:
<ul class="bullet">
	<li>Margin call for all trading accounts will be increased to 150%</li>
	<li>Stop out level for all trading accounts will be increased to 75%</li>
</ul>

## What is a margin call?

When your account equity is unable to cover the margin requirement, your account will be placed under margin call. This does not affect your ability to open new positions.

## What is a stop out level?

If your account is placed under margin call for an extended period of time, it will reach the stop out level where it is unable to sustain an open position. This will lead to your pending orders being cancelled and your open positions being forcibly closed.

#### We strongly advise you to review your account in case any modifications are required to prevent unnecessary losses.
