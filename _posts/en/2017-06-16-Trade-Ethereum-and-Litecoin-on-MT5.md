We’re extremely excited to announce two new additions to our cryptocurrency product range: Ethereum (ETH/USD) and Litecoin (LTC/USD).
 
This comes hot on the heels of the BTC/USD instrument we launched last month, meaning that you can now trade the world’s leading digital currencies on our MT5 platforms for desktop, web, and mobile.
 
<h2>What is a cryptocurrency</h2>
A cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that relies on cryptography techniques and a variation of the blockchain technology (a kind of ‘public ledger’) to secure its transactions.

Cryptocurrencies are:

<ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Anonymous</strong> – Transactions can take place without any exchange of personal information</li>
<li><strong>Decentralised</strong> – No government agency or bank controls it, and there can be no central point of failure. Instead, it’s maintained by a peer-to-peer network</li>
<li><strong>Almost impossible to counterfeit</strong> – The technology that powers cryptocurrencies record each transaction. Several copies of the transaction are available, and can be verified by anyone</li>
</ul>

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are some of the most popular cryptocurrencies around.
