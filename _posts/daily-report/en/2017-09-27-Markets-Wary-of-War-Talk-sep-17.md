### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is on the rise after a volatile session yesterday on the back of 'War' talk with North Korea. 

Gains are being made against most currencies, with the AUD/USD extending its recent losing run and the GBP/USD dropping for four straight days. 

The Canadian dollar is holding up well though, with the USD/CAD making small losses on the back of yesterday's oil price spike. 

The Aussie remains weak thanks to its close proximity to North Korea, while the New Zealand dollar is performing better than yesterday's collapse. 

The yen pairs remain mixed after yesterday's rally on the USD/JPY that ran against movements seen in other pairs.
