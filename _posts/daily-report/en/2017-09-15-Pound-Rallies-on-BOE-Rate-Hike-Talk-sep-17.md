### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound remains in a strong position after guidance from the Bank of England that rates may have to rise sooner rather than later. These comments sparked a surge in the pound, with the likes of the GBP/USD rallying over 1% and the EUR/GBP slumping further. 

Overnight markets also had to content with the latest ‘shot across the bows’ from North Korea with another missile overshoot. Markets seem to have shrugged this off though with the likes of the USD/JPY rallying to erase yesterday’s losses.

Yen pairs are generally on the rise, led by the GBP/JPY.  

The dollar pairs are mixed to negative, with the exception of the GBP/USD which remains firmly in the black.
