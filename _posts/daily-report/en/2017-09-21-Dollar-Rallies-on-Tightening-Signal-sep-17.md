### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning the dollar index is on the rise again after a volatile, but ultimately positive session yesterday. The Greenback has risen as Fed confirmed that it is continuing its tightening phase. It outlined its plans to shrink its portfolio and signalled a potential rate hike in October. 

The dollar pairs were mixed yesterday, with the EUR/USD suffering heavy losses, while the GBP/USD ended up lower, but above the dayâ€™s lows. 

By contrast, the AUD/USD and NZD/USD closed higher after a volatile session. Both are being dragged lower this morning though. 

The yen pairs showed a positive bias, led by the AUD/JPY and the USD/JPY. Activity is muted so far this morning, however. 

The EUR/GBP is higher this morning but rallied hard yesterday on the release of better than expected UK retail sales. 

### Coming up today
