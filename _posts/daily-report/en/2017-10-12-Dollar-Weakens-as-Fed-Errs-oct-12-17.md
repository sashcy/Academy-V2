### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is continuing to sell off after last night’s Fed minutes revealed a divided Fed who are unsure on how to deal with persistently low inflation. The US dollar index dropped yesterday and is showing renewed weakness this morning. 

Dollar pairs have consequently enjoyed gains, led by the AUD/USD and NZD/USD. 

The pound has enjoyed a good week, rallying for five days in a row as Theresa May lives to fight another week. 

The yen pairs are mixed, with the USD/JPY dropping lower, but the AUD/JPY making gains. 

Gold is enjoying the current dollar impasse though, rising for the sixth straight day. 

### Coming up today 

This morning, we get the UK BOE credit conditions survey at 09.30. 

At 13.30, we get US PPI, unemployment claims and Core PPI. 

ECB President Draghi speaks at 15.30, alongside FOMC members Brainard and Powell. 

US crude oil inventories are released at 16.00.
