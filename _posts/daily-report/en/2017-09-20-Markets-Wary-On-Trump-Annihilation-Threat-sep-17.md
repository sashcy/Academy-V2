### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, markets have a ‘risk-off’ bias following Trump’s remarkable speech last night in which he threatened to annihilate North Korea. The dollar index is trading lower again, giving dollar pairs a positive edge. Today’s FOMC meeting is also keeping traders in conservative mode. 

The EUR/USD is continuing its winning run as it makes gains for the fifth day in a row. Other dollar pairs are mixed, with the AUD/USD rising, but the GBP/USD flat. 

The yen is in demand as risk appetite wanes, the GBP/JPY is slipping lower, as is the USD/JPY while other yen pairs remain flat. 

Meanwhile, gold is making small gains so far.
