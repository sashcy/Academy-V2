### Morning Report: 07.00 London

Most dollar pairs enjoyed strong gains, with the EUR/USD making a strong advance. This morning, dollar pairs are decidedly mixed, with the GBP/USD and AUD/USD making small losses, while the EUR/USD is unchanged. The euroâ€™s gains came as Catalonia stopped short of formally requesting independence, opting instead to take a middle ground which keeps dialogue open. 

The EUR/GBP is rising again this morning as it did yesterday, as European risk remains within acceptable limits. 

The yen pairs are mixed, with the EUR/JPY on the rise, but the GBP/JPY slipping back. 

Gold is slipping back this morning after four days of consecutive gains. 

### Coming up today 

Today, we have JOLTS job openings are 15.00. 

FOMC meeting minutes are released at 19.00.
