### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound has extended its rally after a renowned MPC dove appeared to turn hawkish on Friday. The EUR/GBP has continued its dramatic decline, while other dollar pairs advance. 

The GBP/JPY has gapped higher this morning as yen pairs rally across the board. This morningâ€™s move continues the recent trend of minor risk-off trading followed by a rapid return to risk-on training. This recent move comes as analysts expect the US to take a more diplomatic approach with North Korea. 

The AUD/JPY is leading markets higher, helped by the easing of tensions around Korea, the AUD/USD is performing well as is the NZD/USD.

Meanwhile, gold continues to slip from the highs.
