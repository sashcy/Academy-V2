### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Australian dollar remains under pressure after suffering its heaviest selling in over a month. The AUD/JPY is off by 1.34% on the week, with the AUD/USD falling to its lowest since July and the GBP/AUD slumping to its lowest level since June. 

The NZD/USD has followed the Aussie lower, slumping to its lowest level since May. 

The euro and pound remain rangebound, though the GBP/USD posted an encouraging session yesterday. This came after UK GDP increased more than expected yesterday. 

Yen pairs remain mixed, with the USD/JPY dropping off the highs, while the GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY enjoy more positive sessions. 

Oil prices remain above $55, but the USD/CAD continues to enjoy gains, with small losses this morning on the back of a sharp rally this week. 

### Coming up today 

Coming up today, we have the ECB rate statement at 12.45 and following press conference at 13.30. 

US unemployment claims follow at 13.30.
