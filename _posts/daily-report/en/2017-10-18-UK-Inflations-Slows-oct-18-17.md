### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the pound is on the back foot after inflation data came in below expectations yesterday. CPI held firm but other metrics including RPI, HPI and PPI rose less than expected. 

The US dollar has continued to make gains, putting pressure on the dollar pairs, especially the EUR/USD which is down for the fifth straight day. 

The NZD/USD is one of the biggest sellers, as the AUD/USD also continues to edge lower. 

The yen pairs are mixed, with the USD/JPY making gains but other pairs such as the GBP/JPY on the back foot. 

Gold is also off for the third day in a row.
