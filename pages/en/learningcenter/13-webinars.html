		<h3>How To Take Advantage of The Cryptocurrency Bull Run</h3>		
		<p class="font-s">18 December 2017 at 17:00 GMT<span class="block-element">Speaker: <strong>Phil Carr</strong></span></p>
		<p>We have already seen investors across the world flock to Cryptocurrencies, driving prices to all-time highs this year. Bitcoin began 2017 trading around $800 in January. This month it's gone up to more than $8,000.</p>
		<p>So far this year, Bitcoin has increased over 700%. However, that’s nothing compared to the lightning-fast returns seen from other emerging Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Litecoin. With each day that goes by, Cryptocurrencies are quietly becoming an easily useable and practical everyday currency, which simply continues to drive prices up even higher. So if you think you’ve missed the boat – think again.</p>
		<p>This special webinar will cover everything you need to know to trade cryptocurrencies.</p>
		<p class="font-s">Note: *Trading on cryptocurrencies using Binary.com's MT5 trading platform is not available for those residing in Europe.</p>
